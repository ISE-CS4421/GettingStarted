    // Exercise 1: For this Exercise, you are asked to print out all the numbers from 1 - 10 inclusive on separate lines. 
    // Instead of typing each of the lines seperately, you should try using a for loop instead! 
    public static void printNumbers() {
        
    }


    // Exercise 2: For this Exercise, you will be given a number and we want you print out "Inside a Loop!" the number of times that amount is.
    // The variable amount could be anywhere between 5 or 500 so trying to have multiple System.out.println() will not work.
    // This exercise will require you use a for loop to print out "Inside a Loop!" on separate line for the amount of times requested.
    public static void printQuanity(int amount) {
        
    }

    // Exercise 3: For this Exercise, you are asked to write a method that will return the sum of all the natural numbers from 0 to the limit parameter.
    // You should use a for loop and the limit to setup your loop and then return the sum of all those numbers.  
    public static int sumNatureNumbers(int limit){
        return 0;
    }

    // Exercise 4: For this Exercise, you are asked to calculate the factoral value of the paramter number. 
    // Extra: Is there a way to do this with the Streams API? 
    public static int calculateFactoral(int number){
        return 0;
    }

    // Exercise 5: For this Exercise, you are asked to write a program the computes the fibonacci series to the nth term where n is the input parameter.
    // You will need to have a look online for some resources about the fibonacci series to make this easier for you.
    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Exercise 6: For this Exercise, you will create a method that will take input from the end user. 
    // Each time you are to ask the end user "What is your input?" and then you are to print the input to the screen. 
    // This should continue to happen until the enduser inputs "end", when this happens the method should not print end but instead print "Exiting..." and finish. 
    // You will need to use a while loop and some boolean logic to acheive this kind of functionality.
    public static void inputPrinting() {
        
    }

    // Exercise 7: For this Exercise, you will create a method that will take integer input from the user and sum up the inputs. 
    // The loop should end if a user inputs the 0, then you are to return the sum of all the numbers in the following format.
    // Format: "The sum of all inputs equals " + sum 
    public static void sumOfInputs() {
        
    }
    // Exercise 8: For this Exercise, you are print out the below structure useing loops. 
    // Structure:
    // 1 
    // 1 2 
    // 1 2 3 
    // 1 2 3 4 
    // 1 2 3 4 5 
    // The goal of this exercise is not to manually type out the seperate console outputs but instead to find a way of doing this using loops.
    public static void numericTree() {
        
    }
